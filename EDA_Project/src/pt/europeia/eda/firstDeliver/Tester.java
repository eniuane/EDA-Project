/**
 * A simple class/program for obtaining experimentally the execution times of a
 * method summing all integers from 1 to different limits. This may help you
 * devise your own experiments in other cases, but it is *not* intended has a
 * basis for your own code, however. You should study this code carefully and
 * apply the insights gained to your own code. This code is not intended to be
 * in any way complete or to cover all interesting cases. Try to run these
 * tests. Copy the results to «Data» in http://gnuplot.respawned.com/. Then
 * copy the following Gnuplot script to «Plot script»: - set terminal svg size
 * 800,600 enhanced fname 'arial' fsize 10 butt solid set output 'out.svg' set
 * key inside bottom right set xlabel 'sum limit' set ylabel 'time (s)' set
 * y2label 'repetitions' set title 'Execution times of sum of integers from 1 to
 * limit' set logscale x 2 set logscale y 10 set logscale y2 10 set grid set
 * xtics 2 rotate by 90 right format '%.0f' set y2tics format '%g' plot
 * "data.txt" using 1:2 title 'times' with linespoints, "data.txt" using 1:3
 * title 'number of repetitions' axes x1y2

 * The output looks something like the following: - 1 1.7222222222222222E-9
